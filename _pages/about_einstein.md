Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.


<!-- Engineer, Scholar, Gamer, and World Explorer.

As a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at UC San Diego, I am passionate about solving complex engineering problems that have real-world applications and impact. My research focuses on designing, optimizing, and controlling fully-actuated multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for specific search-and-rescue missions in GPS-denied indoor environments. I have developed and implemented novel methods and algorithms for mission-oriented multi-disciplinary design optimization, robust and accurate trajectory tracking, and multi-sensor fusion for indoor navigation and collision avoidance.

I have a strong background and experience in multiple engineering disciplines, including robotics, controls, embedded systems, manufacturing, computer vision, and deep learning. I have worked as a project engineer, a research intern, and an instructor in various settings, applying and enhancing my skills in Solidworks, AutoCAD, Matlab, Simulink, ROS, Python, Java, C, C++, and C#. I also have a master's degree in Computer Science (online) from Arizona State University, and I speak three languages: Chinese, English, and German. I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools, and to collaborate with diverse and talented teams. -->
