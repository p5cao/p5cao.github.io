My research focuses on designing, optimizing, and controlling fully-actuated multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for specific search-and-rescue missions in GPS-denied indoor environments. I have developed and implemented novel methods and algorithms for mission-oriented multi-disciplinary design optimization, robust and accurate trajectory tracking, and multi-sensor fusion for indoor navigation and collision avoidance.</p> <p>I have a strong background and experience in multiple engineering disciplines, including robotics, controls, embedded systems, manufacturing, computer vision, and deep learning. I have worked as a project engineer, a research intern, and an instructor in various settings, applying and enhancing my skills in Solidworks, AutoCAD, Matlab, Simulink, ROS, Python, Java, C, C++, and C#. I also have a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science (online) from Arizona State University, and I speak three languages: Chinese, English, and German. I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools, and to collaborate with diverse and talented teams.</p> </body></html>
